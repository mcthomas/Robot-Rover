# Robot-Rover
A simple, vibrant little 2D platformer made wth Game Maker.  This prototype can be examined and played by cloning the project file and launching it with Game Maker 8.1 lite.

All assets, objects, and codes is contained within the project file.  Most entities, such as the collectibles, portals, spikes, platforms, etc. are borrowed assets.  I designed the robot and enemy sprites from scratch.
