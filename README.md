# Robot-Rover
A simple, vibrant little 2D platformer made wth Game Maker.  This prototype can be examined and played by cloning the project file and launching it with Game Maker 8.1 lite.

All of the code, assets, and objects are contained within the project file.  Many entities, such as the collectibles, spikes, platforms, etc. are borrowed assets.  I designed the robot, enemy sprites, and others from scratch.
